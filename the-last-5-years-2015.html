I Love You,” “Beautiful Creatures”), is a he said-she said standoff with a difference. While Cathy’s story begins at the dissolution of the twosome’s union, Jamie’s account starts with the heady initial rush of instant attraction. The opposing narratives manage to criss-cross during a proposal-wedding sequence and go in opposite directions again from there.</p><p>And, yes, this is mostly one warbled number after another, with minimal dialogue—sort of like “Les Miserables,” but with less of a need to grab for a hanky. The tone is set immediately during the first two opposing interludes, exposing both the benefits and the limitations of this gimmick.</p><p><a href=#>Anna Kendrick</a>, who is reaching Liza Minnelli-esque heights as a performer who can wring emotional honesty out of a show tune, turns Cathy’s lament “Still Hurting” into a quietly devastating heart-crusher. Meanwhile, <a href=#>Jeremy Jordan</a>’s belting style leans towards rafter-rattling as he too quickly exposes Jamie’s unflattering tendency toward shameless self-satisfaction in his ode to his new-found “Shiksa Goddess.”</p><p>From there, it is one giant step for Jamie as he soon grows into a literary sensation—as his opportunities to be unfaithful with adoring groupies expand accordingly once they are married. Meanwhile, poor Cathy feels increasingly sorry for herself as she fails audition after audition and resents being treated condescendingly as Jamie’s plus-one at schmoozy book parties instead as his equal.</p><p>LaGravenese opens up the action with picturesque real-life New York City backdrops such as the Staten Island ferry and Central Park. But even though there are relatable hurtful truths found in this uncompromising pair, there isn’t enough specialness in the characters or their story to make us feel for them. It is pretty much clear from the start that they aren’t the best fit and Jaime’s caddish side will ultimately prevail.</p><p>And, yet, smack in the middle of “The&nbsp;<span>Last&nbsp;5 Years”—perhaps at the two-and-a-half year mark—there are two songs done with such aplomb by both actors and directed with such flair by LaGravenese that you can finally see why this show that has slowly gained in reputation since its 2001 debut is so cherished.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lnJbAtXmUZrCemaKoenN8kG4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
