I have a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep. It takes me a while to wind down. Waking up for work is a chore because I’m still sleepy. So, I’m turning to sleepy tea to help.</p><p>I tried four of the most popular sleepy tea brands on the market to find out which actually helped me sleep. I tried to be equally tired each night and drink the tea at the same time (10 p.m.). I consumed them all in the same place (my bed) and did my regular nighttime routine. After four nights of sleepy tea, there is one clear winner in the category of sleepiest tea on the market.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-day-1-yogi-bedtime-tea><strong>Day 1: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Yogi Bedtime Tea</strong></a></h2><p>Yogi’s Bedtime Tea is delicious. If you’re looking for a soothing glass of tea to enjoy at the end of your day, look no further! Sadly, it didn’t make me any sleepier than normal. Additionally, it gave me heartburn. I struggle with heartburn already so it might not do the same to you if you’re generally heartburn free, but it felt like it was worth mentioning.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-day-2-traditional-medicinals-nighty-night-extra-tea><strong>Day 2: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Traditional Medicinals Nighty Night Extra Tea</strong></a></h2><p>We love Traditional Medicinals in general (the brand shows up more than once on our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best tea ranking</a>), but I tried not to let that sway me in this sleepy tea taste test. That being said, this tea rules! It tastes great. The flavor is super subtle. Plus, it made me tired by the time the mug was empty. I drifted off immediately with my phone still in my hand and all the lights on in my room.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-day-3-celestial-seasonings-sleepytime-extra-tea><strong>Day 3: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Extra Tea</strong></a></h2><p>This isn’t just Sleepytime. It’s Sleepytime Extra. This is probably the most famous sleepy tea of all time and I can see why! This tea is so relaxing and delicious. I like to think I can see through marketing because I work at Spork and see food marketing all day. I am, however, extremely susceptible to cuteness. The sleepy bear on this box of tea is so dang precious. Just looking at it makes me want to curl up in a ball and take a nap. It’s hard to tell if this tea actually made me sleepy or if it was just a placebo effect from seeing the tired bear on the box.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-day-4-pukka-night-time-tea><strong>Day 4: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Pukka Night Time Tea</strong></a></h2><p>Pukka teas always feel so sophisticated to me. The packaging is pretty and the taste is always elegant (we put the brand’s chamomile at number three in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">our best chamomile ranking</a>). Pukka’s Night Time tea is flavorful while still being subtle. As much as I like this tea, I don’t know if it actually made me sleepy. Relaxed? For sure. Tired, on the other hand? Not really.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-final-verdict><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>All these teas are nice. If you want a warm, relaxing cup of tea to end your day, any of the four of these brands of sleepy tea would do. But if you’re looking for a tea that will knock you out, Traditional Medicinals Nighty Night Extra is that tea. It is the Nyquil of the sleepy tea world. If you are having trouble falling asleep, grab a box of Traditional Medicinals and don’t operate any heavy machinery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuv8uenKmxXamyons%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
