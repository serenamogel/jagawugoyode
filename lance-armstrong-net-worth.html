It was remodeled heavily to give some contemporary touches. The Mediterranean-style house sits on close to half-acre of land across the street from Pease Park in the historic Old Enfield neighborhood.</p><p>Even though the house was remodeled, it still has its original style and charm.</p><p>The main house has 8,158 square feet of living space over three-story.

In fact, he’s been collecting the art pieces for almost twenty-plus years.</p><p>Similarly, Lance also loves drinking wine and beer.</p><p>Lance was diagnosed with testicular cancer on October 2, 1996. As a result, he had to go through two operations; One to remove the testis and the other to remove the cancer metastases from the brain.</p><p>He also had to go through intense chemotherapy.</p><p>These days Lance just loves spending his time with his family.</p><h3>Vacations</h3><p>As for vacations, Lance loves going on exotic vacations.</p><p>Back in 2014, Lance was spotted enjoying a Hawaiian vacation with his girlfriend and two children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lance-Armstrong-Vacation.jpg><p>He was seen showing off his curves as he paddled shirtless in the sea.</p><p>Other than this, no information about vacations is available.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>Lance Armstrong has his own foundation, which he established after he recovered from testicular cancer. The foundation was called Lance Armstrong Foundation but later renamed to Livestrong foundation.</p><p>The foundation raised over $500 million for cancer research, treatment, and support. Lance himself donated over $6.5 million personally.</p><p>Apart from that, Lance Armstrong has been involved in 15 charitable organizations and supports 15 causes, including Cancer, Children, Poverty, Sports, Physical Challenges, and many more.</p><p>Similarly, Lance took part and ran in NY Marathon in support of his foundation Lance Armstrong Foundation.</p><p>Likewise, Lance also donated his shoe which he wore during one of his Tour de France wins, to be auctioned off for Leukemia Research.</p><h2>Movies, Endorsements, Investments, and Books</h2><h3>Movie</h3><p>Lance Armstrong has made some screen appearances throughout his career.</p><p>In 2017 he appeared in the TV Movie<strong> Tour de Pharmacy</strong>; similarly, in 2004, he appeared in <strong>Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story</strong>.</p><p>Likewise, Lance also appeared in 2006 <strong>You, Me and Dupree</strong> and 2008 <strong>The Simpsons</strong>.</p><h3>Endorsements</h3><p>During the peak of his career, Lance endorsed some of the top brands in the world, including Nike, Honey Stinger, Trek, Easton-Bell Sports, Motorola, and 24-hour fitness.</p><p>However, after his doping scandal, he lost all of his endorsement deals which cost him more than $75 million.</p><p>As he was banned from professional racing due to allegations that he used steroids.</p><p>Along with his endorsement deals, Lance was forced to give up his seven Tour de France medals.</p><h3>Investments</h3><p>Apart from investing in real estate, Lance also invested in a company that would later deliver him a multi-million dollars fortune.</p><p>At a time, Lance was having a hard time in terms of finance, but his investment in a ride-sharing company Uber saved his family financially.</p><p>As he stated in one of the interviews, he invested about $100,000 in Uber when the company was valued at only $3.7 million.</p><p>During that time, he was making a ton of money from his endorsement deals and cycling career.</p><p>He did not even have any idea what Uber was at that point in time.</p><p>Currently, Uber has a total market value of $120 billion. Even though we do not know the actual number about how much Lance earned from the investment, but it’s presumably pretty valuable today.</p><p>Some sources even claim that Lance made over billion dollars from the investment, but that would be completely untrue.</p><p>Lance’s Uber investment is not more than $30 million today.</p><p>Probably even less than that with the tax cuts and other government charges.</p><p>But we cannot deny that the investment was just $100,000 and is worth more than $20 million after taxes.
