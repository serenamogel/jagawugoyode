Here’s how I make dinner in the summer: First, I open the fridge to see what produce I have. (We also have fresh herbs growing on our back deck, and I love to use those as much as possible, too.) Next, I take stock of what I have in my pantry. Sometimes, there’s a can of coconut milk or tomatoes. Often, there are legumes like chickpeas or lentils, and always, there are grains like Lundberg Family Farms rice and quinoa. I love to use Lundberg’s products because the company has a longstanding…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>In my first cookbook, I shared a recipe for Coconut Rice with Brussels Sprouts. It was an instant hit after the book came out, and it’s remained a reader-favorite recipe to this day. As much as people love Brussels sprouts, I suspect that the recipe’s popularity isn’t really because of the veggies. It’s because of the coconut rice. I mean, how could it not be? Coconut rice is rich and fragrant, with a sweet, buttery coconut flavor. It’s fantastic in bowls and as a side dish, but it tastes so good that I could eat forkful after forkful straight from…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>A few years back, if you’d offered me olive tapenade at a party or gathering, I would have politely declined it. I’d always thought of myself as an adventurous eater, but for some reason, olives just hadn’t been for me. But recently, I’ve finally(!) started to come around to them. I like them in Greek salad and on bruschetta, and now, I even love olives in tapenade! Who knows? If you’re an olive skeptic, this recipe might win you over too. If you’re not familiar with tapenade, it’s a salty, briny olive spread that originated in the Provençe region of…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>What better way to kick off summer than with a strawberry margarita?! It’s fruity, it’s refreshing, and it’s SO darn fun. And despite its impressive appearance (check out that ruby red color!), it’s easy to make. Blitz up a quick strawberry puree in a blender, and add some to a cocktail shaker with 5 simple ingredients. Then, just shake and serve! I especially love this strawberry margarita recipe because it has an extra-summery twist. Instead of making it with regular simple syrup, I use simple syrup infused with basil. It brings so much freshness and depth to this already-delicious drink.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>What’s more fun than regular pasta salad? Tortellini pasta salad! The tortellini are chewy and cheesy, not to mention adorable, and they make this summer salad such a blast to eat. Their nooks and crannies catch the zingy Italian dressing, and their pillowy texture contrasts beautifully with the juicy cherry tomatoes and creamy white beans. If you’re looking for a fresh dish to pass at a cookout this weekend (or a yummy idea for lunch next week), this tortellini salad recipe would be perfect. Oh, and if you’re vegan or dairy-free, you can still make this recipe! We’ve tried making…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Like macaroni salad and potato salad, three bean salad takes me right back to my childhood. It was something I ate at potlucks, picnics, and even the occasional school lunch. I remember liking the sweet and tangy dressing, but the mushy canned green beans? Not so much. So, to kick off picnic salad season this year, I’ve got a new three bean salad recipe to share with you. In many ways, it’s just like the one I ate as a kid. It features dark red kidney beans and hearty garbanzos, and it’s tossed in a punchy (though considerably less sweet)…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These BBQ sides will steal the show at any summer cookout.&nbsp;They range from creamy potato salad to summery slaws to herb-flecked pasta salad and smoky grilled watermelon.

Make one for your next summer gathering. I promise it’ll be a hit! Our Best BBQ Sides Easy Pasta Salad If I’m tasked with preparing a side dish for a picnic or cookout, this recipe is my go-to.

They’re fluffy, golden brown, and easy to make with basic pantry ingredients. But best of all, they’re&nbsp;bursting&nbsp;with juicy berries. With 2 full cups of blueberries in the recipe, you get one in every bite. Douse your stack with a quick blueberry compote for even more blueberry goodness, or stick to classic fixings like butter and maple syrup. No matter which toppings you pick, you’ll love these blueberry pancakes. Blueberry Pancake Recipe Ingredients Here’s what you’ll need to make this blueberry pancake recipe: Blueberries, of course!

It’s one of my favorite recipes to make when I have a surplus of fresh berries (or a big bag of frozen berries) on hand. It tastes so good that you could eat it with a spoon, but it’s really meant to be used as a topping. Drizzle it over pancakes, oatmeal, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for a delicious pop of bright berry flavor.

I love this Asian leafy green. If you haven’t worked with it before, it has a delicate flavor with hints of mustardy spice, and you can eat every part of it – the crisp, juicy stalks as well as the lush, dark green leaves. It lends itself well to all sorts of recipes. Try tossing it into a stir fry or soup. Steam it and add it to a grain bowl. Or enjoy it raw in a…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I’m a convert: this Instant Pot quinoa recipe is my new favorite method for cooking quinoa. It’s quick, it’s reliable, and – most importantly – it’s hands-off. I love that I can add the quinoa to the Instant Pot, get it cooking, and move on to something else. Whether I check on it in 20 minutes or in an hour, I’ll end up with a pot of fluffy, perfectly cooked grains.
