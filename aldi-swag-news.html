Aldi made that possible for its die-hard fans last week by releasing a limited-time-only collection of Aldi swag.</p><p>If you know me, you know that I long ago took Trader Joe’s to be my lawfully wedded supermarket (till death do us part), but I actually had to stop and think about this for a second. If people love Aldi so much that they want to wear Aldi gear, maybe it’s time I checked out an Aldi? If only there was one near me–I looked it up and the closest Aldi is 100 miles away from where I live. Bottom line: TJ’s has nothing to worry about … for now.&nbsp;</p><p>Quite honestly, I would love to rep a grocery store’s siq threads (whether I actually shop there or not). I just love grocery stores. So I looked into exactly what options this line of Aldi gear offers, and, boy, is it both very exciting and VERY affordable.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram">https://www.instagram.com/p/Cckn6f6L53O/</figure><p>They’ve got women’s pajama sets for $10 (WOW!) that say “Aldi All Day” on them. They’ve got $5 “Head to Tail Aldi Fan” plushy pet toys for your favorite grocery-loving doggo. They’ve got an “Aldi All Day” hydration bottle, some Aldi-colored slides (Aldi has its own color palette, y’all), an “Aldi All Day” keychain, and even Aldi socks. If you really wanted to, you could dress entirely in Aldi chic from ya shirt to ya shoes for literally 20 dollars.</p><p>And while I can’t speak to the quALDI (get it? quality?) of these items (I have to assume they aren’t ~premium~ considering most $10 pajama sets aren’t), I think the idea is awesome. If my local grocery stores started doing this, I would totally pick up a pair of TJ’s PJs and some Safeway Slides to wear around the house. Or, let’s be real, I’d wear these things out in the world, possibly to work, and definitely to my next fancy dinner party just to see what people would say.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/BEST-TRADER-JOES-CHEESE-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_HEADER.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-best-cheeses-at-trader-joe-s><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Cheeses at Trader Joe’s</a></h2><p class=related-date>April 14, 2022</p><p>Trader Joe’s is for cheese. It is the reason to go to Trader Joe’s over another grocery store. Sure, the dips are okay and the frozen section can occasionally feature some strong offerings, but the&nbsp;cheese&nbsp;selection is something different. Something spectacular. Something totally next level.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJmcmbZuv9aanmamlazAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
