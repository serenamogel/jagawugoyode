Gryffindor receives the most attention in the <a href=#>books</a> because Harry and the majority of his friends are Gryffindors. This implies that Gryffindor is portrayed in a somewhat biased manner as well. Since Slytherins make up the majority of the villains, they are frequently discussed but typically in a bad way.</p><p>Even if the other two houses may not receive as much attention, they should nevertheless be investigated further. Each one of them is distinctive and fascinating in its own way. Knowledge and ingenuity are the hallmarks of Ravenclaws. On the other hand, Ravenclaws can occasionally be a little snobbish, haughty, or proud.</p><p>Updated by Rose Graceling-Moore on October 23, 2021: With the Fantastic Beasts series, the Harry Potter franchise is still growing, and now that The Secrets of Dumbledore has a <a href=#>new release</a> date for 2022, fans will finally receive their next Harry Potter fix. With the return to the UK and a focus on Dumbledore’s past, the Fantastic Beasts series created some whole new Houses in the American Wizarding World. It is possible that some new Ravenclaws will soon arrive, complete with all the good and bad characteristics that this house stands for.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> BEST: Witty</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> WORST: Oblivious</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> BEST: Intuitive</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> WORST: Calculating</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> BEST: Quick-Thinking</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Worst: Self-important</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> BEST: Intelligent</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> WORST: Perfectionism</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> BEST: Creative</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> WORST: Cold</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">11</span> BEST: Independent</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">12</span> WORST: Distant</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">13</span> BEST: Individualism</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">14</span> WORST: Judgemental</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">15</span> BEST: Wise</a></li></ul><h3><span id=BEST_Witty>BEST: Witty</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Moaning-myrtle.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=750 height=375 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Sharp groaning Myrtle may not be the most endearing character in the show, but she definitely brings a sense of humor to the scenes in which she appears. She speaks without stopping to consider what she would say; yet, this can be rather funny—especially when it is done at Harry’s expense.</p><p>She and many Ravenclaws, including Professor Flitwick and even Lockhart, have a natural gift for humor. This can result in some amusing movie scenes as well as some intriguing character conflicts.</p><h3><span id=WORST_Oblivious>WORST: Oblivious</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gilderoy-lockhart-Cropped.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=750 height=375 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It’s interesting to note that, despite their intelligence, Ravenclaws occasionally display ignorance, such as Lockhart and Luna. In the instance of Lockhart, he is so preoccupied with himself that he is oblivious to everything else that is going on, even the fact that Hogwarts is in danger and Harry can hear snakes in detention.</p><p>On the other side, Luna is just a carefree person who doesn’t give a damn what people say. She is so committed to learning more about obscure magics that she even realizes she doesn’t fit in. This particular brand of hyper-focused ignorance is unquestionably a Ravenclaw trait.</p><h3><span id=BEST_Intuitive>BEST: Intuitive</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Luna-Lovegood.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=700 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Although Ravenclaws are renowned for their intelligence and knowledge, intuition is a crucial skill as well. They may enjoy learning, but they don’t just learn by rote or through books—some of the most perceptive Hogwarts students are among them. with a thorough comprehension of how things operate.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u11248bbdaea2fd2e941cc8fc6ea8aeb9><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>18 Hufflepuff Traits To Tell If You Belong In The World Of Harry Potter</span></a><p>Since they are driven by logic, they can easily read situations or draw conclusions from events and circumstances. Luna, for example, has excellent emotional intuition. She can tell when Harry needs company and when he needs alone time.</p><h3><span id=WORST_Calculating>WORST: Calculating</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5.-Gilderoy-Lockhart-Promo-Photo.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=750 height=375 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Although Ravenclaws seem to have an inexhaustible supply of knowledge and wit, they have a tendency to abuse this advantage. The best—or rather, worst—example of this is Professor Lockhart.</p><p>He has dedicated his entire professional life to exploiting other people and appropriating their knowledge. He might not be as smart or bold as everyone thinks, but he isn’t a moron when it comes to business and public relations. Though some could contend that this is more of a Slytherin quality, Ravenclaws can also exhibit it because of their brilliance, which can breed pride and ambition.</p><h3><span id=BEST_Quick-Thinking>BEST: Quick-Thinking</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pandora-Lovegood-Luna-in-Harry-Potter.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=690 height=345 sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The speed with which Ravenclaws can think on their feet is one of their greatest assets. They are likely to be the first to conceive of a solution in a difficult circumstance. This could be quite helpful in a Wizarding Duel, especially given how many spells Ravenclaws are familiar with. They are also more likely to know the origins of spellcasting and be able to invent new spells or modify existing ones due to their passion of learning.</p><p>If someone is stressed for time, they can always rely on a Ravenclaw—but only if that Ravenclaw is eager to assist.</p><h3><span id=Worst_Self-important>Worst: Self-important</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Harry-Potter-Professor-Lockhart-1.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=750 height=375 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ravenclaws can come off as a little haughty and conceited because they frequently are aware of how smart they are. Only the Hufflepuffs are seen as being humble; Ravenclaw is not the only house that might be perceived as haughty; Gryffindor and Slytherin also exhibit this trait.</p><p>However, Ravenclaws have a tendency to be a little more haughty about their wit and logic. Although some Ravenclaws, like Professor Lockart, are self-important, this does not imply that all of them are. Some people, like Luna, are less haughty because they don’t care how they stack up against others.</p><h3><span id=BEST_Intelligent>BEST: Intelligent</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cho-Chang-Harry-Potter.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=750 height=375 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Intelligence is one of the most well-known characteristics of Ravenclaws. Although intelligence may appear to be quite straightforward, it actually spans a wide spectrum. Luna, for instance, isn’t the most book smart, but she is emotionally clever, inquisitive, and different.</p><p>Because of their intelligence, Ravenclaws frequently value education for its own sake. While residents of other homes are capable of being extremely intelligent, they frequently view education as a means to an end rather than as something they like doing for its own reason.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u88a9a1dc52293d5a9415262c2f98edef><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Things About Ravenclaw That Surprised Every Harry Potter Fan</span></a><h3><span id=WORST_Perfectionism>WORST: Perfectionism</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rowena-Ravenclaws-diadem.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=700 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It’s not unexpected that this can lead to perfectionism given that Ravenclaw is all about intellect. Occasionally fussy and picky, ravenclaws.</p><p>They appear to be more concerned with both aesthetics and carrying out tasks in the proper or “ideal” manner. Slytherin and Gryffindor may be more likely to take shortcuts than Ravenclaws, who tend to be more meticulous. This may also be related to a propensity for being a little haughty, or at least viewed as such. They can frequently count on people to hold themselves to the same high standards that they do.</p><h3><span id=BEST_Creative>BEST: Creative</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cho-Chang-and-Luna-Lovegood-of-House-Ravenclaw.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=750 height=375 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>While Ravenclaws aren’t always rigid when it comes to learning, they are often very intelligent when it comes to things like books and facts. Ravenclaws are renowned for being quite inventive and innovative.</p><p>The likes of Luna Lovegood are a good illustration of this. A Ravenclaw’s brilliance can appear in a variety of ways, and for some members of this house, creativity plays a significant role in how they view themselves and interact with the outside world. Because of how adaptable their mind is, they are able to think in remarkable leaps of creativity and put things together more quickly than others.</p><h3><span id=WORST_Cold>WORST: Cold</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cho-Chang-1.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=700 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The way the Hogwarts house system divides the pupils from one another is one of its major drawbacks. Students from other houses don’t socialize much because of the competitiveness it fosters.</p><p>While members of all the houses are sometimes judgmental and stick to their own ways, Ravenclaws do so in a way that is a little bit more distant and icy. They frequently keep to themselves and distance themselves from some of the dramas and problems that the rest of the school has. They could come out as aloof and rather careless as a result. When Harry and Ron pose as Crabbe and Goyle and inquire about the location of the common room, this is a prime example. They ask a Ravenclaw by <a href=#>accident</a>, who’sniffs’ them out for even implying they live in the same house.</p><h3><span id=BEST_Independent>BEST: Independent</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Luna-Lovegood-1.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=700 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As one may anticipate from their artistic natures, Ravenclaws are also independent and original. The more advantageous aspect of their aloofness is their independence. As a result, they frequently behave independently and avoid conflict.</p><p>Sometimes their introversion might serve as an inspiration for their originality and creativity. This is best exemplified by Luna, and it’s unfortunate that Ravenclaw’s other residents aren’t given more attention. They resemble Gryffindors in some ways because of this, and they are also prepared to bend the rules since they will think of clever justifications for why they aren’t breaking the law.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u2b894d2c208058c48f76b2c772f50ba9><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Noteworthy Gryffindor Traits That Make Or Break Them</span></a><h3><span id=WORST_Distant>WORST: Distant</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cho-Chang.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=700 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ravenclaws tend to be a little more remote and have their heads in the clouds because they are all about intellect and study. These pupils can be a little forgetful because they don’t typically worry about <a href=#>the little things</a> in life. It can occasionally be more difficult to connect with them since they are more likely to become sidetracked by whatever huge concept they are contemplating.</p><h3><span id=BEST_Individualism>BEST: Individualism</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Luna-Lovegood-Reading-the-Quibbler-from-Harry-Potter.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=700 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This is yet another admirable quality of Ravenclaws that shows through in a variety of ways. The most blatant illustration of this may be found in Luna Lovegood, who likes to be quite individualistic in her appearance and self-expression. Because Ravenclaws don’t give a damn what other people think of them, they can freely express themselves in original and fascinating ways.</p><p>However, other other Ravenclaws exhibit their individuality as well, such Cho Chang. Ravenclaws are difficult to categorize as a group because they tend to all be more solitary and inward-looking.</p><h3><span id=WORST_Judgemental>WORST: Judgemental</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/helena-ravenclaw-ghost-hogwarts.jpg alt="hufflepuff traits,gryffindor traits,slytherin traits,hufflepuff vs ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw characters,ravenclaw symbol,ravenclaw colors,ravenclaw traits good and bad,ravenclaw traits pottermore,ravenclaw traits list,ravenclaw traits reddit,ravenclaw traits harry potter,ravenclaw traits bad,ravenclaw traits wizarding world,ravenclaw traits tumblr,ravenclaw traits test,gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff ravenclaw traits,harry potter ravenclaw traits,gryffindor vs ravenclaw traits,slytherin vs ravenclaw traits,hufflepuff and ravenclaw traits,bad ravenclaw traits,all ravenclaw traits,slytherin and ravenclaw traits,ravenclaw house traits,ravenclaw personality traits,ravenclaw vs gryffindor traits,ravenclaws traits,ravenclaw vs hufflepuff traits,ravenclaw vs slytherin traits,ravenclaw house traits pottermore,ravenclaw and slytherin traits,ravenclaw and hufflepuff traits" width=700 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Even though Ravenclaws have many admirable qualities, including brilliance, inventiveness, and introversion, these qualities can also make them more judgmental. They firmly believe that they are more intelligent and well-mannered than pupils from other houses.</p><p>Although they don’t exhibit the same levels of conceit or arrogance as Gryffindors or Slytherins, Ravenclaws do have a tendency to pass judgment on others. They simply have a tendency to pass judgment on various things and frequently show less reluctance to do so.
