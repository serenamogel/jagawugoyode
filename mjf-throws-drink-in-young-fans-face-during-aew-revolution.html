Max didn’t spare the crowd from his heel tactics at the Chase Center.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here for our full coverage of AEW Revolution.</a></p><p>MJF entered the crowd during the opening moments of the match. The AEW World Champion trash-talked the San Francisco crowd. He even grabbed a drink from a woman’s hand and threw it in a young fan’s face.</p><p>This isn’t the first time MJF has disrespected fans in attendance. Back on the February 15th episode of Wednesday Night Dynamite, MJF once again showed a lack of regard for the fans in attendance by making a controversial remark during a commercial break. <a href=#>Specifically, he dropped brutal line about abortion</a> that left many fans shocked and offended. This is not the first time that MJF has shown such disrespect towards fans, as he has a history of using offensive language and behavior to garner attention.</p><p>Despite his controversial behavior, MJF is currently the reigning AEW World Champion and is defending his title against Bryan Danielson in a 60-minute Iron Man match at the <a href=#>ongoing Revolution pay-per-view event</a>. Many fans are eagerly anticipating this highly anticipated showdown and are curious to see if MJF will be able to retain his championship in the face of such a formidable opponent. However, some fans may be hesitant to support MJF given his past behavior and offensive comments. Regardless, the match promises to be a thrilling and intense battle between two of the biggest names in professional wrestling today.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What are your thoughts on MJF’s controversial behavior and offensive comments towards fans?
