However, since the outer skin is so stiff and fibrous, McDowell believes that it may be difficult for the body to completely digest, particularly if consumed raw. The effect is that “remnants” might wind up in the faeces, she said. Some individuals may also have stomach ache or flatulence as a result of taking it.<span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Also, did you know that undigested food may appear as blood in stool?</h3><p>&nbsp;While undigested food in faeces is generally not a cause for concern, there are specific instances in which it should be taken into consideration.
