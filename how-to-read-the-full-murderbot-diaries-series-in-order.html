Unlike your typical apocalyptic robots-taking-over-the-world scenario, our protagonist, known as Murderbot, decides to spend his newfound independence watching… soap operas.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>That’s right; unlike what his name suggests, Murderbot is more interested in watching serial dramas than actually murdering folks, all the while trying to divine the meaning of life and his place in this strange world of humans, robots, cyborgs, and AI.</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>This unconventional premise may not amount to much at first glance, but through Martha Wells’ brilliant prose and storytelling chops, you’ll fall in love with The Murderbot Diaries almost as soon as picking it up. And as I said earlier, this will be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a convenient way to get back to reading</a>, as each novel is a self-contained short story. In fact, the first one, All Systems Red, is just a little over 30,000 words, or roughly 100 pages.</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=108 data-injectable=false>In this article, you’re going to see a list of every published Murderbot Diaries book in order of release.</p><h2 id=h-how-to-read-the-murderbot-diaries-in-order data-injectable=false><strong>How to read The Murderbot Diaries in order</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/murderbot-novels-wgtc.jpg><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>There have been 7 books and 3 short stories in the series.
