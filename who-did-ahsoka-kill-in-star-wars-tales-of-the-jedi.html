While three episodes touched on the surprisingly sympathetic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">origin story of Count Dooku</a>, the other half of the first season <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">checked in on three different points in the life</a> of Ahsoka Tano, from her birth to her training with Anakin Skywalker, to what she got up to after Order 66.</p><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>It’s the finale, titled “Resolve,” that’s perhaps the most significant new chapter in Ahsoka’s story, however. While the Togrutan former Jedi’s life has been extensively explored in both The Clone Wars and Rebels, as well as Ahsoka, this episode specifically bridges the gap of what happened to her during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the immediate aftermath of the Empire’s rise</a>, revealing a hitherto unknown dark moment of the soul which Ahsoka, being the heroine that she is, was ultimately able to overcome.</p><h2 id=h-what-happens-to-ahsoka-in-the-tales-of-the-jedi-finale data-injectable=false>What happens to Ahsoka in the Tales of the Jedi finale?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/star-wars-tales-of-the-jedi-1.jpg><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=837 data-injectable=true>“Resolve” opens by offering a new perspective on a heartbreaking moment ingrained on the memories of Prequel Trilogy lovers everywhere: the funeral of Padme Amidala. It’s revealed that Ahsoka attended her wake in disguise, as well as detailing how Bail Organa helped her escape from Coruscant. Leia’s adoptive father lends Ahsoka a commlink should she wish to get back in touch, but she is reluctant to accept it, admitting to feeling tired of the fight. Unfortunately for Ahsoka, the fight is not done with her.</p><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>The second half of “Resolve” jumps ahead an indeterminate time later, with Ahsoka now living in a farming village on an unknown planet, going by the name Ashla. She’s managing to lay low, until a repulsorlift cart collapses a ton of hay bales onto a young woman who’s become her friend, forcing Ahsoka to use her Force powers to save her life. While the woman promises not to tell anyone of Ahsoka’s secret nature, her brother has likewise realized the truth and is less loyal.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who does Ahsoka kill in “Resolve?”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ahsoka-Inquisitor-Tales-of-the-Jedi-Resolve-1.jpeg><p data-characters=561 data-current-count=861 data-injectable=true>Once “Ashla” and her friend return at night after selling their harvest, they find their settlement razed to the ground, and an Inquisitor on the scene. The brother had contacted him to sell out Ahsoka hoping for a “reward,” which the Inquisitor is all too happy to grant him — provided that reward is a quick death by lightsaber. Naturally, Ahsoka saves the greedy traitor and battles the Inquisitor herself, who realizes her true identity. Ahsoka ultimately disarms the villain and beheads him with his own double-bladed lightsaber.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>Knowing that more Inquisitors will come, Ahsoka tells the settlers they have to leave this planet. The final scene unveils she has finally contacted Bail Organa for help in getting them off-world and is now once again ready to rejoin the fight. This neatly leads into where Ahsoka’s journey continues in Star Wars Rebels, in which she is introduced as a major leader in the nascent Rebel Alliance, going by the callsign “Fulcrum.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is the identity of the Inquisitor Ahsoka kills?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/the-sixth-brother-star-wars-tales-of-the-jedi.png><p data-characters=597 data-current-count=897 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">As voiced by Clancy Brown</a>, the Inquisitor who seeks out Ahsoka is credited simply as “Inquisitor,” so exactly how he fits within the ranks of the Inquisitorius is unclear. When he was briefly glimpsed in the trailer, fans assumed he might be an adaptation of the Sixth Brother, who debuted in 2016’s Ahsoka novel by E.K. Johnston, due to a slight physical resemblance. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnston has denied</a> they are the same character, though, and this Inquisitor’s death contradicts the Sixth Brother’s defeat in that novel so it is unlikely they are intended to be one and the same.</p><p data-characters=68 data-current-count=68 data-injectable=false>Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi is available to stream on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mm6KcXZa1tLvKmmSkoZyheqq6jKyrmqpdrK6zv4ytmKWdo2K8p3nToZxmopWZtnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
