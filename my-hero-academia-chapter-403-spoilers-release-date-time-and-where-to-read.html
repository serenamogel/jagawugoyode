He is seen reading a kids‚Äô superhero book with his mother as his adult self reflects on how normal his life used to be. There was nothing particularly ‚Äúsuper‚Äù about him, so All Might doesn‚Äôt really feel as though he has an origin story. Still, he still finds the path that he chose important.</p><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>Back to the present, All for One has just avoided All Might‚Äôs murder attempt by destroying his gauntlet and paralyzing the former Pro Hero with the quirk he stole from Stain. With the U.A. battlefield floating again, Gentle intends to go help All Might but is stopped from doing so when the villain shoots a laser at it. This forces Gentle to stay where he is, holding up U.A., while the American jet pilots attempt to step in. They intend to save All Might in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star and Stripe</a>‚Äòs honor but are quickly destroyed by All for One.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>As the overarching antagonist holds All Might‚Äôs body in his hands, about to kill him, Commander Agpar, Deku, and Tsukauchi&nbsp;can only watch in panic and hopelessness.
