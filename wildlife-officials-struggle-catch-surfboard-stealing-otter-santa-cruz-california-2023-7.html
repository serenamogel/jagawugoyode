They tracked and then attempted to catch the otter with a bait surfboard.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Mark Woodward, a wildlife photographer who posted the video to Twitter, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>told a local FOX News affiliate</a>&nbsp;that he saw a team of five divers attempting to lure <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>the otter</a> onto the board so they could capture it.</p>—Native Santa Cruz (@NativeSantaCruz) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 13, 2023</a><p><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>The otter jumped</a> onto the board briefly, but escaped before the divers were able to grab it with a net, the outlet reported.</p><p>"They can't throw a net over it because it will get tangled and drown," Woodward said. "That's also why they can't tranquilize it."</p><p>Kevin Connor, a spokesperson for Monterey Bay Aquarium, said Otter 841 is considered a danger to the public because it is ignoring its natural survival instincts, <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>ABC reported</a>.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>"When we see this type of behavior exhibited by otters, it is a sign that they no longer have that healthy fear of human beings that allows them to stay safe in the wild away from us," Conner said.</p><p>Conner told the outlet that the otter's mother, Otter 723, was released from the aquarium in 2017 and that there were some reports of her approaching boats and kayaks but "nothing to the extent that we've seen with Otter 841."</p><p>Still, the incidents caused the US Fish and Wildlife Service to deem Otter 723 "unreleasable," so she was recaptured and discovered to be pregnant with 841, Conner said, according to ABC.</p><p>Conner said there are now no plans to euthanize either otter. Once Otter 841 is captured, Conner said it would be evaluated by veterinarians and then will likely spend the rest of its life in captivity in either a zoo or an aquarium.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The US Fish and Wildlife Service did not immediately return Insider's request for comment Saturday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufony4tcudo6KelWK8p7LInKCapKNiwLW%2B1KCepZ1dmK61r8dmqq6qlpe8or7DZqqtnZGhtq%2BzjKirrZ2iYsCiutOaZJyqpa96pK3Lop2oqp6erm5%2Bj2tqZm8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
