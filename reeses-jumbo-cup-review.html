It needs to be at least…three times bigger than this!”</a> then you were probably disappointed when Reese’s came out with Reese’s Big Cup and it was only about two times larger than the King Size. But never fear, you Reese’s loving fiends, because we got our hands on Reese’s newest invention: the Reese’s Jumbo Cup. It’s the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">same thickness as the Big Cup</a> but quite a bit wider. So, based on that and the nutrition facts, if my math is mathing, that would make the Jumbo Reese’s roughly the size of four King Sized Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups in one (which, mind you, is how many come in a King Sized package), and twice the size of a Big Cup. All that is to say, they were not lying to us. Clocking in at 400 calories worth of chocolatey, peanutty goodness, this thing is in fact “jumbo.” My main concern? Surface area-to-volume ratio, i.e. smaller things have more coating per middle and big things have more middle per coating. Will this honkin’ jumbo cup be too PB-forward? Is that even possible? We tasted it to find out.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#eb6822></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="reese's jumbo cup review" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NPR_REESES-JUMBO-CUP_INSET.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">New Product!</p><strong>Reese’s Jumbo Cup</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Hersheyland</a><p><strong>Pros:</strong> If you are still wondering how big this thing is, I would describe it as roughly the diameter of an air hockey puck and at least twice as thick. See? I play (arcade) sports. In other words, it is a little less than three inches in diameter and it’s about ¾ of an inch thick. Don’t worry, it still smells like a Reese’s, and still comes in a cute little cardboard tray just like the King Size ones, but y’all, this tray has four walls like a french fry tray. Plus, it has no brown paper around the cup. I have some thoughts on why this particular cup may not be worth your time but first I must say: If you eat it upside down (the cup inverted, not you), the texture is quite pleasant. The top (which is actually the bottom in this case) gives way beautifully, and the thick chocolate layer on the bottom (which is actually the wider top part of the cup) is a welcome textural change. But most people don’t eat their Reese’s upside down, I just happen to be the whimsical little Zooey Deschanel of eating PB cups.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> I hinted at it before but the Reese’s Jumbo Cup’s top layer of chocolate is simply too thick. The top layer of chocolate is twice as thick as the bottom, coming in at around ¼ inches (yes, almost a third of the thickness of the whole thing). It does have a bit more peanut butter flavor than chocolate flavor in an average bite, but it is also less balanced and less melt-in-your-mouth delicious than a normal Reese’s. I could see a dark chocolate version of this being good but this one is just a bit too sweet. Maybe they were trying to solve the surface area-to-volume ratio by putting more chocolate on the top layer? Either way, this was fine (it is PB and chocolate after all, so it obviously didn’t taste bad by any means), but I think I’d rather have many small Reese’s Cups than one Jumbo Reese’s Cup.</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKqVmsCmv4yjrKaan2KwtryMq5yvoZWsfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
