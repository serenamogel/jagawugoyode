Sure enough, the opening chapter of the Star Wars series’ latest run saw Mando and his adorable charge face-off against some space pirates, as led by the attention-grabbing pirate king Gorian Shard.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>After aiding Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) in dealing with some of Shard’s goons on the now-gentrified Nevarro, Pedro Pascal’s bounty hunter later encounters their boss himself while on the next leg of his journey to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">restore his Mandalorian honor</a>. This reveals our first look at Shard, who belongs to one of the most unique-looking species we’ve seen in all of Star Wars. But do we know anything about Shard’s species or where he comes from?</p><h2 id=h-gorian-shard-could-have-a-secret-connection-to-yoda-not-grogu data-injectable=false>Gorian Shard could have a secret connection to Yoda, not Grogu</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-mandalorian-gorian-shard.jpg><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=725 data-injectable=true>At this juncture, it’s unclear what species Gorian Shard belongs to as we have never seen his like in the Star Wars universe before, be it in live-action, in animation, or in the comics. With his green skin, hulking form, and moss-like hair, it’s currently unknown exactly how his character design came together, but it’s probably fair to say that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DC’s Swamp Thing was at least a partial inspiration</a>.</p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>We’re not sure of his species designation, however, it’s just possible that we can hazard a guess at Shard’s planet of origin. And if we’re right then it may mean the pirate king has a secret connection to Yoda, not Grogu. Given his physical attributes, it would make sense if Shard hails from a planet that’s covered in swamplands. So what’s a world in the Star Wars galaxy that fits this description?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/artofmandolorian2-cover-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mandalorianseasontwo-p239a-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mandalorianseasontwo-p238b-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mandalorianseasontwo-p214a-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mandalorianseasontwo-p164b-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mandalorianseasontwo-p109b-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Yes, it’s Dagobah. Located in the Sluis sector of the Outer Rim, Dagobah was of course where Yoda retired to after the rise of the Empire, the site of Luke’s training in The Empire Strikes Back, and ultimately the place of the Jedi Grand Master’s death and merging with the Force. Apart from being particularly closely connected to the Force, Dagobah is also most known for its many swamps and bogs.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>While various non-sapient species native to the planet have already been identified in SW lore, we’ve not heard of any sapient beings originating for Dagobah, so that could make Shard coming from there less likely. If so, then he may instead hail from a different — but meteorologically similar — planet in the Dagobah system.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=false>Until we learn more about Gorian Shard as The Mandalorian season three continues weekly on Disney Plus, it’s just possible the pirate king could provide yet another intriguing link between Grogu and his older, wiser counterpart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylu4ywnGajnqTEbsDHnmSsqJWYtqa%2FjKidZqyYmnqxtdGaq55lk5a9ta3Ip2Sipl2ptaZ5zJqlnZmcpL%2Bqrc1mqp6Zo6S7bn%2BMnqeiq5%2BZsm59jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
