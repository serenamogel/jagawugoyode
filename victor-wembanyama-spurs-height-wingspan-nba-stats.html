And, as you could tell, he loves the game. He was smiling a lot while playing the game."</p><p>Everyone from Dirk Nowitzki and Giannis Antetokounmpo to Kristaps Porzingis and Durant have influenced Wembanyama's game.</p><p>There was a time when big men were forced to play inside the painted area and only crossed the 3-point line when offense was transitioning to defense.</p><p>If Wemby had arrived in the 1980s, there's a chance that he would've played a different sport entirely or failed to find a place in the NBA.</p><p>In 2023, 3s are worth more than 2s, the court is more open than ever, and The Association has embraced Wembanyama's incredibly diverse attack with open arms.</p><p>Then there's the fact that Wemby plays the game with joy.</p><p>The French rookie shoots, sprints, passes and defends like hustle is still in style and he has everything to prove to the basketball world.</p><p>“His enthusiasm for the game — you can tell that through the TV and playing against him,” Durant said. ”He’s his own player, own person. He’s going to create his own lane and is much different than anyone else who has played.”</p><p>An athletic family helped shape Wembanyama.</p><p>He's humble, worldly and self aware off the hardwood, recognizing his unique place and clear championship potential.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/11/user-expressly-acknowledges-agrees-downloading-856828651.jpg><p>But Wemby is not Wemby without his height and wingspan.</p><p>He blocks a shot, races down the court and slams home a basketball.</p><p>He flashes in the paint, calls for the ball like a 1980s center, then easily lays it in while barely lifting his feet off the floor.</p><p>There are alley-oop dunks, smooth passes and knock-down 3s that display supreme NBA confidence.</p><p>Wembanyama has already had several "Welcome to the NBA" moments.</p><p>After beating Durant twice, the Spurs were blown out 152-111 by the Indiana Pacers on November 7, and the young Frenchman was held to 3-of-12 shooting in an embarrassing 41-point defeat.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on talkSPORT">Read More on talkSPORT</h2><p>But Wembanyama is a basketball unicorn who doubles as an alien.</p><p>If the Spurs rookie keeps dominating the hardwood like this, the NBA will have found its replacement for The King.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraGlmZ4VyhJNoraKbpKS%2FbsPEppmapqmWuqJ50qmsq6tdnbKqs8etZLChnpzAsa3NZqWbmV2owaLA0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
