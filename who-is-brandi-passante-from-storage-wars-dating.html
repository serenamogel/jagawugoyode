However, they revealed in the first episode that they had split during their time away from the series.

Schulz’s absence from Storage Wars came after he was charged with one count of misdemeanor domestic violence. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to TMZ</a>, Schulz was accused of pushing Passante twice while at a bar in Orange County, California, in May 2021.

Along with a bird, Passante had the word “Free” tattooed on the inside of her middle finger. She wrote that the tattoo was inspired by a “very difficult situation” she escaped from.&nbsp;</p><p>“Although everyone assumes, this means that I am a huge ‘[Lynyrd] Skynyrd’ fan…I do love this song!” Passante wrote. “But, this tattoo means so much more. To me, it means that somehow, by the grace of god, I managed to escape a very difficult situation that so many people fall victim to. I will be eternally grateful, for the life and freedom, without fear that I get to live now. I am also grateful for the empathy and grace that I am able to give others as a result of the things that I have endured! I love you all & thank you for all the support! #nationaldomesticviolenceawarenessmonth #freeasabird.”</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=146 data-injectable=false>Season 15 of Storage Wars premiered on June 6, 2023, and Passante is once again wheeling and dealing on the front lines to find hidden treasures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlkqeur7DIZqeaq6OWu7WxjJ%2BpqKVdqMGwvsCgnGavkafAbrDAraCnn18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
