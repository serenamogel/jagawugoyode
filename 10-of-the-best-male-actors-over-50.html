Check out these seasoned thespians who have aged like a fine wine.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>How is it that some actors just seem to get better(and hotter) with age? These 10 actors prove that age is just a state of mind and there is still plenty of fun and success to be had, far after the middle age mile marker. So join us as we peruse the list of over 50 actors who are still making movie magic not to mention some who are still making us swoon.</p><h2 id=h-10-matthew-mcconaughey-54 data-injectable=false>10. Matthew McConaughey-54</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>Matthew McConaughey blessed us with his first on-screen appearance all the way back in 1993 at the age of 23. His breakout role as Wooderson on Dazed and Confused captured the attention of audiences and producers alike, and pretty soon it seemed like he was everywhere. From an Oscar-winning performance in 2013’s Dallas Buyers Club to an appearance in Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi spectacular Interstellar (2014), and in Civil War drama Free State of Jones (2014), he gave three towering performances that proved McConaughey’s substantial range and his longevity.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>He is now 54 and was recently in the 2019 hit The Gentlemen and 2020’s Disclosure, proving that he has no intention of slowing down anytime soon–oh and he’s still pretty easy on the eyes too.</p><h2 id=h-9-hugh-jackman-55 data-injectable=false>9. Hugh Jackman-55</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Everyone’s favorite Marvel half man half wolverine is none other than Mr. Hugh Jackman. Yet his role as the beloved(and often shirtless) Wolverine in the X-Men franchise is not his only acting acclaim. He has also been in such Hollywood hits as Deception (2008), Les Miserables (2012), and Prisoners (2013). Recently he starred in the 2022 tearjerker The Son, once again showing he is more than just a sexy set of fangs.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Yes although he is currently 55 years old, this actor is not looking long in the teeth. His healthy diet and strict workout routine ensure not only do his acting accreditations stay intact but so do his six-pack abs. It’s possible that 55 is just the jumping-off point for this talented Australian native, as it looks like he has many more years of success to come.</p><h2 id=h-8-brad-pitt-60 data-injectable=false>8. Brad Pitt-60</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=685 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>Let’s be real — is there anything Brad Pitt hasn’t been in? We think the list of movies or types of roles he hasn’t played is probably far shorter than all the things he has been in. Yet just for reference sake or in case you’ve been living under a rock for the past few decades, a few of his most well-known roles include the films The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), Moneyball (2003), Ocean’s Eleven (2001), Twelve, and Thirteen, Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) and the list goes on and on. He began his acting career all the way back in the 80s and hasn’t taken a break yet, and even better, doesn’t seem like he’s planning to.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>His recent appearances include the 2022 films Babylon, Bullet Train, and The Lost City — that’s right, three movies in one year. How is that for still going strong? He is currently 60 years old and seems somehow to still be in his prime. We just want to know what exactly is in those genes and how we can get ahold of whatever elixir of youth he uses.</p><h2 id=h-7-johnny-depp-60 data-injectable=false>7. Johnny Depp-60</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=642 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>Johnny Depp, like, Brad Pitt has been in more movies than most people can count. His career began all the way back in 1984 with Nightmare on Elm Street, when he was only 23 years old. He also doesn’t seem to ever have taken a break. Although there was a small hiatus during his well-publicized and highly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dramatic trial </a>with his ex-wife Amber Heard. Otherwise, Depp has been consistently churning out movies almost yearly ever since. He has been in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory (2005), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1999), Pirates of the Caribbean (2003), Rum Diary (2011), Rango (2011), 21 Jump Street (2012), and so many more.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>Now at the age of 60, he is still going strong with the recent release of the 2023 hit Jeanne Barry and 2020’s Minimata. Despite his teeth looking a little <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">worse for the wear </a>these days, overall he is still the handsome, devil-may-care rebel image of his youth.</p><h2 id=h-7-ralph-fiennes-61 data-injectable=false>7. Ralph Fiennes-61</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>Ralph Fiennes has a unique talent for playing both the hero and the villain with equal merit. He seems to enjoy switching back and forth between the roles showing off his acting prowess and broad range. We have seen him as the savior in The Constant Gardener (2005) and the villain in both Schindler’s List (1993) and the Harry Potter (2001) Franchise. No matter what role he plays, this British heartthrob brings the heat and the intensity.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>He began his career in the early 1990s with hits such as Strange Days (1995), Wuthering Heights (1992), and The End of An Affair (1999). Now at 61, he is recognized for his recent roles in The Forgiven (2021), The Menu (2022), and The Rat Catcher (2023). His acting, his accent, and his regal bearing have only gotten better with time, and we can’t wait to see what he comes out with next.</p><h2 id=h-6-james-earl-jones-93 data-injectable=false>6. James Earl Jones-93</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>While the Darth Vader voice itself may be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">now retired </a>the man behind it, James Earl Jones is Hollywood royalty. He is one of the very few actors to get the acting “Grand Slam” of an EGOT, or Emmy, Golden Globe, Oscar, and Tony. It’s no surprise when one considers his amazing pedigree, with knockout performances in The Great White Hope (1970), Field of Dreams (1989), The Hunt for Red October (1990), and countless others.</p><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>Now in his ninth decade at the age of 93, Jones may have bowed out of Star Wars, but otherwise shows no signs of slowing down. Most recently he has reprised his role in Eddie Murphy’s favorite Coming to America (1988) in the 2021 sequel and of course, his well-known vocal performance of Mufasa lives on in the 2019 live-action version. His voice is one of the most recognized in Hollywood and his acting accolades are the stuff of legend. Yes, 50 was really just his starting gate, and even 90 wasn’t his finish line.</p><h2 id=h-5-anthony-hopkins data-injectable=false>5. Anthony Hopkins</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>To many, Welsh actor Anthony Hopkins will forever be Hannibal Lecter, the deranged serial murderer with very particular tastes in cuisine who played a game of psychological cat-and-mouse with Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) in Jonathan Demme’s The Silence of the Lambs (1990).</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Yet Hopkins’ work is far more extensive as seen in his role of the repressed butler opposite his would-be love interest Emma Thompson in The Remains of the Day (1993.) Or his brilliant portrayal of Richard Nixon in Oliver Stone’s 1995 biopic Nixon. Even now at the age of 86, he is still giving memorable performances such as his 2021 Academy Award-winning role of a man succumbing to Alzheimer’s disease in The Father.</p><h2 id=h-4-denzel-washington-69 data-injectable=false>4. Denzel Washington-69</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=840 data-injectable=true>With ten Oscar nominations including two wins, Denzel Washington’s credentials are impressive. Those wishing to take a closer look at the actor’s best performances will be hard-pressed to choose between dozens of great turns: as a determined Civil War soldier in Glory (1989), as Malcolm X in Spike Lee’s 1992 biopic, or as an alcoholic airline pilot in Flight (2012). Few Hollywood actors have been so consistently on top of their game for so long. Washington began his career in the 1980s and has been churning out hits ever since.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Now at the age of 69, he just keeps the acting acclaims coming with his appearance in Equalizer’s 2 and 3 and Gladiator 2(2024). With his roles in high-action films and franchises, it is safe to say he is still in prime shape and we are willing to bet there will be even more films and awards under his belt in the years to come.</p><h2 id=h-3-jeff-bridges-72 data-injectable=false>3. Jeff Bridges-72</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>Rowdy, gruff, and hard-edged pretty much sums up Jeff Bridge’s rebel with a cause, salt-of-the-earth appeal. In fact, he seems to finally have aged into his demeanor, he’s always seemed a grumpy old man at heart. In fact, as time goes on, his voice gets gruffer, his advice gets harder and his roles get even more exciting. He’s won several awards over the course of his decades-long career including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a SAG award.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>His most memorable roles include Crazy Heart(2009), The Big Lebowski(1998), True Grit(2010), The Giver(2014), and Hell or High Water(2016.) His recent role in the series The Old Man(2022), at the age of 72 seems to clench the concept that there is no end in sight for his achievements.</p><h2 id=h-2-tom-hanks-67 data-injectable=false>2. Tom Hanks-67</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=720 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>The two-time Academy Award winner may have begun in comedy, but by the mid-1990s he was already showing remarkable range. His work playing a gay lawyer with AIDS who sued his employers for discrimination in Philadelphia (1993) bagged him his first Oscar with more awards on the way. His roles&nbsp;such as astronaut Jim Lovell in Apollo 13 (1995), a World War II U.S. Army captain in Saving Private Ryan (1998), and a marooned plane crash survivor in Cast Away (2000) further impressed critics. More recent roles in the much-underrated sci-fi epic Cloud Atlas (2012) and the Western News of the World (2020) only underscored his versatility as Hanks progresses to being one of Hollywood’s most revered elder statesmen.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>He is currently 67, and not only recently starred in the film A Man Called Otto(2022) but also released a new novel The Making of Another Major Motion Picture. It certainly seems Hanks is in the prime of his life as not only has he mastered his acting craft, but he is now moving on to literature!</p><h2 id=h-1-george-clooney-62 data-injectable=false>1. George Clooney-62</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=646 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>George Clooney is in his 60’s but join us in saying–he does not look it. Is it possible he looks better now than he did in his 30s? While opinions on his physical attributes may be subjective, something that is not is his ongoing acting success. He first won hearts and turned heads in his role on the hit series ER in the early 90’s but it was soon apparent, that he had a lot more to offer than just good looks. Four Golden Globes and two Academy Awards later, O Brother Where Art Thou (2000), Oceans Eleven (2001), Twelve and Thirteen, The Ides of March (2011), and The American (2010) are but a few of his best-known roles.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Now at the age of 62, he was recently in Ticket To Paradise(2022) and The Boys in The Boat (2023) with rumors of several more big hits on the way. Yes, there is no arguing that George Clooney is still just as much of an acting heavy hitter and heartthrob as he was in his early ER days and we can’t wait to see what he does next.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=false>Hollywood is notorious for having an age cutoff, claiming that actors and actresses are past their prime at certain ages. Well, we don’t know who set those rules in Hollywood but these 10 50+ actors are breaking it in style. So cheers to these Hollywood gems that are not only breaking the barriers but rewriting the narrative altogether.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoaGlln5t6tbTEZpmeq6RiuqK4xGaYnKyfp8Buu9WeqWZtYGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
