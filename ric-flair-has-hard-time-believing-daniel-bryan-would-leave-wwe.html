Last month, Bryan also mentioned that&nbsp;<a href=#>his WWE contract is expiring soon as well</a>.&nbsp;As reported earlier, Bryan’s<a href=#>&nbsp;contract expired earlier in the month.</a></p><p>Many fans since then have been wondering where Bryan will go to next if he doesn’t re-sign with WWE. However, it seems a WWE Hall Of Famer believes Daniel Bryan isn’t going anywhere.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Conrad Thompson</a>, Ric Flair talked about Daniel Bryan possibly leaving WWE. Flair stated that many of Bryan’s family members still work for WWE and for this reason, Flair believes that Bryan isn’t going to part ways with the company.</p><p>“He doesn’t have an option. He’s gotta go home with Brie [Brie Bella, Daniel Bryan’s wife]. That’s all speculation. He’s one of the nicest kids I’ve ever met in the business, and he would no more leave the WWE than no one. I would have a very difficult time believing he would leave the WWE. If he does, I’d be very surprised. That whole family and everybody is tied to the WWE. I was under the impression he wanted to go home and spend more time with the kids. I don’t know what he’s gonna do. Whatever he does, I wish him the best.”</p><p>WWE has&nbsp;been pushing&nbsp;<a href=#>hard to get Daniel Bryan to sign new deal</a>&nbsp;and it was also reported that&nbsp;<a href=#>WWE is leaving the door open for Daniel Bryan’s return</a>. However, Bryan isn’t interested<a href=#> in full-time backstage role </a>either. We will have to see what Daniel Bryan will do next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ye49uZmpuX6e2pHnFpZiiql2drrR5x5qpnWWknrqmecGeo6Kdpp67qHnDmqWinZxir7PFwKdksKelobFuuMSarZ5lp6yycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
