The text is by Stigter, and&nbsp;the narration is read by Melanie Hyams.</p><p>The approach—seeing the past in present-day locations—owes something to "<a href=#>Shoah</a>," although the organizing principle here is less clear. (The anecdotes are not chronological and seemingly not even geographically arranged; McQueen circles back to certain areas.) Some of the most powerful moments involve sites still in use in some form today. (Should you ever take a train through Amsterdam's Centraal Station, note that, according to the film, an estimated one-quarter of the city's Jews "departed" through that station in the war years.) Omissions are&nbsp;also&nbsp;suggestive; I could have missed it, but I don't think "Occupied City" ever shows the Anne Frank House, one of Amsterdam's most famous locations, although Frank is certainly mentioned.</p><p>One aspect of the film is uneasy-making. McQueen shot much of "Occupied City" while Amsterdam was shut down during Covid, and some of the juxtapositions he creates in the editing are a tad suspect. Surely when the film indicates that a square used as an assembly point for the roundup of Jews during the Holocaust is now a vaccination center, or that curfews were used in both periods, we're not meant to see a literal parallel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/64657d7c306fcc75bf61457f/content_strange_way_of_life_resized.jpg><p>Pedro Almodóvar's half-hour western, <strong>"Strange Way of Life,"</strong> which premiered at Cannes this afternoon, is a pretty minor exercise, a chance for both the director and the actors to try on some cowboy duds for no reason in particular. The film centers on Jake, a sheriff, and Silva (Pascal), a rancher he worked with as a hired gun 25 years ago. They were also lovers, and when they reunite at the start of the film, they are much more open about that past than, say, <a href=#>Jake Gyllenhaal</a> and Heath Ledger's characters in "<a href=#>Brokeback Mountain</a>."<br></p><p>But sex aside, "Strange Way of Life" consists of little more than a basic sketch for a showdown. (Jake plans to track down Silva's son for committing a murder, and Silva wants Jake to leave him be.) Given 70 minutes, Budd Boetticher might have mined some dark ambiguities from the scenario while building toward the eventual three-man confrontation. But the rhythms here are off,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;tension&nbsp;is nonexistent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmn52jqba3rcusZpyZnqOytHmRaWlsZZ2ku7TAxKtkraCVYrSwuMOmmKdlk5bApnnOnJquqJmasW6vyK2wZqukp66vs8RmrpqxXaSzbrjIn5w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
