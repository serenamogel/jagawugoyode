What’s that? You’re dubious? I get it. For a long, long time, bland pizza crust smeared with sauce and piled with veggies (too many veggies, usually) was the universal vegan pizza option. But, in recent years, there have been major advancements in vegan meat and cheese technology. Now, vegans can grab something delicious from the grocery store freezer and not have to scrape everything off it later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We rounded up some of the best frozen vegan pizza options and gave them a taste. Actually, we rounded up some of the best frozen vegan pizza options and one pizza made with dairy cheese that slipped past us until we took a bite and were like, “Wow! I wouldn’t know this wasn’t real cheese!”&nbsp; Still, that one wasn’t even our favorite of the bunch. When I say these vegan frozen pizzas give non-vegan frozen pizzas a run for their money, I mean it. Here are our favorites, in descending order.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

That’s the case with the crust of this Amy’s vegan pizza, which is pretty much orange with seasoning, like it was rubbed with a savory, garlicky tomato sauce. If you’re a crust queen, this is the best vegan frozen pizza for you, but I will warn you that the cheese on this pie is gluey as hell. In my notes I described it as “wet mush.” It’s also topped with lots of olives (love) and some kind of mushy fake meat substance that I don’t think would work all that well on its own, but works perfectly atop this pizza. All in all, it’s pretty good if you can get past the texture of the cheese.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_VEGAN-FROZEN-PIZZA-update_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best No Cheese</p><strong>Amy’s Roasted Vegetable No Cheese</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Ralphs</a><p>Okay, I know that I already bad-mouthed boring, cheeseless pizzas covered in veggies, but this no-cheese pizza covered in veggies from Amy’s is an exception to the rule. Instead of a red sauce, this pleasant, pliable crust is smeared with caramelized onions and then scattered with a reasonable amount of artichokes and red peppers. If you love a nice onion-y focaccia, you’ll like this. If I’m being totally honest, I don’t know that this would quell my craving for a cheesy pizza, but if you want something simpler (not to mention less oily), this is a great vegan frozen pizza option. I can imagine slicing this up tavern style and serving it as an appetizer at a dinner party. That’s sophistication, baby.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_VEGAN-FROZEN-PIZZA-update_INSET-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Supreme</p><strong>Daiya Supreme</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>In addition to being topped with Daiya’s excellent, creamy, dreamy fake cheese medley (which you’ll read more about in a sec), this vegan supreme pie has a really choice array of toppings: <a href=#>vegan sausage</a>, red and green bell peppers, and quartered button mushrooms. All of the flavors work well together and nothing really overshadows anything else, although I will say the mushrooms are especially nice and flavorful.

Like, honestly, they could call it a 16-cheese pizza and no one would know the difference—it’s all water, oil, and starch—but Tattooed Chef is better than that! Just like Daiya (see below), they went with creamy mozzarella- and cheddar-inspired shreds on this pie, but I’d say opt for this pizza if you’re into <a href=#>cauliflower crust pizza</a> like I am.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_VEGAN-FROZEN-PIZZA-update_INSET-01b.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Cheese</p><strong>Daiya Cheeze Lover’s Pizza</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Affiliate</a><p>Daiya is a big name in <a href=#>vegan cheese</a>, so it makes sense that the brand knows its way around vegan cheese pizza. At the risk of sounding like a 1990s commercial for some kind of diet dessert for ladies, this pie is sinfully gooey. Texturally, it’s almost like <a href=#>Velveeta</a> (I don’t know why we aren’t all eating pizzas covered in Velveeta), and it has a little tang to it, too. “This cheese is like paste in the best way possible,” senior writer <a href=#>Jordan Myrick</a> said when they took a bite. The crust isn’t particularly flavorful, but this is like that good (if not terrible nuanced) cafeteria pizza you’ve been craving since you graduated from middle school. And besides being dairy free, it’s also gluten and soy free.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_VEGAN-FROZEN-PIZZA-update_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Trader Joe’s Vegan Meatless Meat Eaters Pizza</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Trader Joe’s</a><p>Trader Joe’s didn’t even register on our list of the <a href=#>best frozen pizzas</a>, but gott-damn if they don’t make the best vegan frozen pizza I’ve ever had. When my colleague <a href=#>Danny Palumbo</a> took a bite, he observed that it tastes like tacos. He’s not wrong and I’ll tell you why: veggie chorizo, baby. Instead of just faux pepperoni and faux Italian sausage (snooze), this pie is scattered with faux pepperoni, faux Italian sausage, and crumbles of savory, spicy, paprika-rich vegan chorizo. The cheese on this pie doesn’t melt as well as Daiya’s, but it’s still plenty creamy and serves as a great backdrop to the chorizo. Try this and let us know if you love it as much as we did.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tasted:</strong> Daiya Fire-Roasted Vegetable Thin Crust Gluten Free Pizza, Sweet Earth Veggie Lovers, Sweet Earth Pepperoni Lovers (not vegan)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuwsSgmKdllqe8u7HNZqeisqqWfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
