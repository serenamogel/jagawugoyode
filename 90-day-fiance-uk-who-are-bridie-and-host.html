The show has captured the interest of viewers all over the world, and anticipation for the next season is high.</p><p><a href=#><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsngr.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/90-Day-Fiance-UK-Season-1-Couples.jpg decoding=async alt="90 Day Fiance UK: Who Are Bridie And Host? Wiki - Meet The Couples" width=1400 height=700 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The ups and downs of previous 90-Day Fiancé couples after they married are chronicled in this show. In this series, the couple has already had to meet online but has not yet begun the K-1 visa application process. This reality series is devoted to couples in which the American spouse permanently relocates to their partner’s native country rather than the foreign partner. The K-1 Visa is intended to give the couple enough time to plan and carry out their marriage ceremony. The visa is not designed to allow the couple time to “decide IF” they want to marry. Each couple has already signed documents saying they have agreed to marry each other, and the documents have been presented to US immigration authorities to obtain the K-1 Visa.</p><p>Discovery+ UK announced on June 9 that the first season of 90 Day Fiancé UK would premiere this summer. The ninth season of 90 Day Fiancé UK is all set to premiere on Sunday, July 24, 2022, exclusively on Discovery Plus. The series will be divided into 12 one-hour segments.</p><p>In the upcoming season of 90 Day, Fiancé, Bridie, and Host are among the cast.
