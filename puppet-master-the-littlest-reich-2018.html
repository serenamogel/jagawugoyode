Craig Zahler, the writer/director/songwriter behind bloody, but soulful&nbsp;genre hybrids "<a href=#>Bone Tomahawk</a>" and "<a href=#>Brawl in Cell Block 99</a>."&nbsp;"The Littlest Reich"&nbsp;features&nbsp;brief flashes of Zahler's&nbsp;flinty wit and machismo, but it also often feels like a bizarrely&nbsp;misconceived&nbsp;side project.&nbsp;One by one, disposable supporting characters—several&nbsp;of whom are attacked simply&nbsp;because they are gay, Jewish, or black—die ostensibly comical deaths.&nbsp;The only people who can stop their pint-sized&nbsp;murderers—who descend on a hotel full of unsuspecting guests in Pottsville, Texas—are sad sack comic book artist Edgar (<a href=#>Thomas Lennon</a>), his obnoxious BFF Markowitz (<a href=#>Nelson Franklin</a>), and&nbsp;his literal&nbsp;girl next door&nbsp;love interest&nbsp;Ashley (<a href=#>Jenny Pellicer</a>). Unfortunately, none of these characters are well-developed&nbsp;beyond an isolated&nbsp;scene or two, like when&nbsp;Edgar is confronted by his&nbsp;uptight/suspicious&nbsp;dad Tom (James Easton) after he moves in with his parents following a messy divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>The rest of the film's non-puppet-related scenes are dominated by&nbsp;Markowitz, whose&nbsp;persistent&nbsp;need to mock&nbsp;Edgar and his girlfriend is pretty&nbsp;monotonous and predictable. Markowitz is what you'd get if&nbsp;you half-heartedly&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;make&nbsp;"South Park" brat&nbsp;Eric&nbsp;Cartman&nbsp;simultaneously repellent&nbsp;and&nbsp;likable.&nbsp;First he jokingly asks Ashley to take her top off,&nbsp;then he tries to banter with&nbsp;bartender&nbsp;Cuddly&nbsp;Bear (Skeeta Jenkins), a stereotypically sassy black&nbsp;supporting character who talks in the third-person and understandably&nbsp;looks askance at&nbsp;Markowitz after he tries to hit on and then (again,&nbsp;jokingly)&nbsp;asks Cuddly&nbsp;Bear&nbsp;to&nbsp;poison a&nbsp;fellow&nbsp;bar patron who he describes as&nbsp;a "bookish blonde" (Alison Viktorin). Markowitz's pseudo-playful banter&nbsp;with&nbsp;Cuddly&nbsp;Bear&nbsp;suggests&nbsp;that&nbsp;he's&nbsp;self-aware enough&nbsp;to&nbsp;know&nbsp;that&nbsp;he's&nbsp;a&nbsp;nuisance,&nbsp;but&nbsp;also&nbsp;ostensibly&nbsp;sympathetic&nbsp;enough to be laughed off as a harmless sex pest.</p><p>Still, you might wonder why&nbsp;Markowitz is&nbsp;the most developed character in "Puppet Master: The Littlest Reich" given that Edgar is constantly&nbsp;presented as&nbsp;the film's lead protagonist. You also might find some answers in the scene where Markowitz, upon checking into his hotel, is confronted by a smirking, passive-aggressive comment from the concierge: "You must be Markowitz," the unnamed&nbsp;hotel employee says.&nbsp;Markowitz scoffs and asks if that remark was made because he looks Jewish. The concierge shrugs and says, "Well, are you Markowitz?"&nbsp;Markowitz sheepishly admits that he is, and the concierge moves on, his dickish point seemingly having been proven. Because apparently you're only telling it like it is&nbsp;if you casually point out that&nbsp;a Jewish stranger appears to be Jewish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46prKmolal6rq3SrZyrZaSdsm64yK2rpZ2jqXqzscicn2ZqYGaF</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
