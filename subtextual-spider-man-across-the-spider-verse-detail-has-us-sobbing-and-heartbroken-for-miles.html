And why wouldn’t it be, seeing as Miles Morales is tested and plans to redefine what it takes to be Spider-Man. However, there was one moment in the film that might have gone over people’s heads but actually may have some emotional and heartbreaking backing attached to it.</p><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>Tumblr user&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@kindaorangey</a>&nbsp;noticed something after watching the highly anticipated Spidey-Sequel. They’ve called out Miles’ decision to pursue a career in physics and realized why he’s insistent on wanting to attend Princeton’s physics program in New Jersey rather than stay in Brooklyn. They believe that Miles decided to study physics instead of art because it’s his best chance for reuniting with his friends. This theory was so heartbreaking that it also made its way onto the r/Spiderman subreddit:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Biggest gut punch of the film.

In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a>, we saw him being skilled in art through graffiti. This talent was later emphasized in some scenes in the sequel. So hearing the idea of Miles dropping art to learn the ways and scientific theories of the multiverse to reach his friends, only to have learned that they could have gone to him all this time is pretty sad. Miles didn’t have to let go of his dreams, but he wanted to in order to see Gwen and Peter one more time.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>This led to a debate about whether Miles should forgive Gwen and Peter in <a href=#>Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse</a>. Unfortunately, many agreed that those two shouldn’t be forgiven that easily, despite Gwen’s newest mission to save her best friend along with her “band.” After all, he was upset when it was revealed at the climax of the film that both Peter and Gwen knew about Miles’ “anomaly.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Lost-Lu</a> from discussion<a href=#></a><br>in<a href=#>Spiderman</a></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2.png><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Lost-Lu</a> from discussion<a href=#></a><br>in<a href=#>Spiderman</a></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3.png><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>It will be interesting to see how Miles will react to his friends once they inevitably reunite on Earth-42 in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse. Will he be able to forgive them for lying to him, or will things instantly go back to the way they were? Knowing how Miles reacted when he learned that his friends were hiding something from him, hopefully, the writers will give Miles the emotional riot act he deserves.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is now showing in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8tMHBrZyxrKWWuW6%2Fz6Kbnqpdoq6vecCcqairo2LBqbGMrKeinJWnerex0aycZpyVqa6quIyhmKxlpah6tLvBm6Cnn12Wu6V5x56Yq6ySp7yssc1mnaiqXaK2rbHSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
