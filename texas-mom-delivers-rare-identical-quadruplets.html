Jenny wasn’t on fertility treatments either.</p><p>Even three babies seemed like a few too many at first.</p><p>“It sounds horrible to say, but I don’t know if it was necessarily tears of joy. We were completely overwhelmed and, frankly, terrified,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Chris told the Washington Post.</a></p><p>Experts say a naturally occurring pregnancy of quadruplets is exceedingly rare, happening about once in every 11 million births.</p><p>“This situation is so incredibly rare that there are only about 72 documented cases of spontaneous, identical quadruplets ever,” Dr. Brian Rinehart of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said in a press release.</p><p>Other parents who have <a href=# rel=noopener>delivered new babies during the pandemic</a> have had their own challenges, from contracting the virus themselves to a spouse being called into the delivery room on FaceTime.</p><p>Jenny, 35, went into labor the day before Dallas County’s mandatory stay-at-home restrictions were announced.</p><p>“It’s a different world we live in now, and it’s really interesting to be going through all of this. We literally gave birth on the day the pandemic broke out,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>told CBS DFW last week</a>.</p><p>Today, sons Hudson, Harrison, Henry and Hardy are doing well. Even the smallest baby, at just 1 pound, 15 ounces, didn’t require oxygen, although they all stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for several weeks. Last week, the whole family of six was home at last.</p><p>“It was kind of hard to wrap our head around but we’re doing good with it. It’s fun, it’s exciting,” said Jenny. “To be able to share these little miracles … it’s just been really special.”</p><p>Even though the baby boys are starting to develop their own individual personalities, they still wear ankle bracelets so their parents can tell the difference between them.</p><p>“We confuse them from time to time,” Chris, 35, said.</p><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>9</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3F7j25ma2lfqbK5rdJmpKilXZmyrbXVnqmsZaKWv6Z5yJ2cp6yZmK6tedCumJ2qpaW5psDSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
