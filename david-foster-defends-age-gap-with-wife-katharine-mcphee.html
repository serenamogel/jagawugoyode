We think we have it pretty together.”</p><p>Foster speaks from experience: He’s been married five times — including once to<a href=#> former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Yolanda Hadid </a>— and has five daughters, seven grandchildren, and one son with McPhee: Rennie, nearly a year old.</p><p>The mega-producer, who has worked with stars like Celine Dion, Michael Bublé and Josh Groban, was <a href=#>criticized recently for proudly sharing a photo of McPhee.</a></p><p>“🎼what baby!” he captioned the photo of the singer, clad in a black bikini that showcased her ripped abs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/david-foster-katharine-mcphee_04.jpg><p>Comments abounded that Foster’s remark was sexist and old-fashioned.</p><p>Foster, who has largely been a behind-the-scenes figure in the music industry, has in the last few years started performing by himself. Last month he appeared at the Wynn Las Vegas Encore Theater with his show “An Intimate Evening with David Foster.” It returns for three more dates this April — and will include a visit from McPhee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/david-foster-katharine-mcphee_01.jpg><p>“When she comes out, she gets such thunders of applause,” he said, “I love it. I love having her with me.”</p><p>“Our baby’s 11 months old, so she wants to get back to work full-time — and it won’t be with me, probably,” says Foster. “I’m really grateful to her that she just goes, ‘OK, I’ll grab the baby, I’ll come out, and sing a few songs.’ It’s really great — she’s a star.”</p><p>The pair wed in June 2019 and <a href=#>welcomed Rennie last February.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN%2BjmlpaGhoZLGiwsidZJ%2Bno6mys3nDnp2eppSoeqKzxGaemqhdrLa1tIywoJ%2BdXaCutbTAq6CnnV2isLG0xJ5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
