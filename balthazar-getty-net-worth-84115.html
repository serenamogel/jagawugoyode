He auditioned for the lead role in the movie <i>Lord of the Flies</i> after being spotted by a casting <a href=#>Director</a>, Robin Joy Allan, in his art class at school. During the 1990s and early 2000s, he appeared in the films <i>Young Guns II</i>, <i>Natural Born Killers</i>, <i>Judge Dredd</i>, <i>Mr. Holland's Opus</i>, <i>White Squall</i>, <i>Lost Highway</i>, <i>Big City Blues</i>, <i>The Center of the World</i>, <i>Deuces Wild</i>, <i>Ladder 49</i>, <i>Feast</i>, and the television miniseries <i>Traffic</i>.</p><span>1993</span><p>Paul Balthazar Getty was born in Tarzana, Los Angeles, and raised in San Francisco before being educated in the United Kingdom at Gordonstoun. His great-grandfather was <a href=#>J. Paul Getty</a>, founder of Getty Oil, and at one time one of the <a href=#>richest</a> men in the world. His grandfather was John Paul Getty, Jr.; his father was John Paul Getty III. His mother, Gisela (nÃ©e Schmidt), is a German-born professional <a href=#>Photographer</a> and documentary filmmaker. His parents divorced in 1993. He has a maternal half-sister, Anna (born 1972).</p><span>2000</span><p>In 2000, Getty married fashion designer Rosetta Millington. They have three daughters: Grace, Violet, and June Catherine, and a son, Cassius Paul. He had a well-publicized affair with <a href=#>English</a> <a href=#>Actress</a> Sienna Miller but eventually returned to his wife.</p><span>2006</span><p>Getty guest-starred on the television series <i>Charmed</i> as Richard <a href=#>Montana</a>, a male witch romantically linked with Paige Matthews. He appeared in the fifth season of the television show <i>Alias</i> as Agent Thomas Grace. He starred, alongside <i>Alias</i> costar Ron Rifkin, in the ABC prime time drama <i>Brothers & Sisters</i>, which first aired in September 2006. Getty played the role of Thomas "Tommy" Walker, third-born of the five Walker siblings.</p><span>2008</span><p>In late 2008, media reports indicated Getty's contract as a full-time series regular in <i>Brothers & Sisters</i> would not be renewed due, in part, to budgetary and storyline considerations. In the Season 4 premiere, Getty was still listed in the principal cast, but he did not appear. Getty made his return to the series in the sixth episode of Season 4. Although he no longer appeared in every episode, he continued to make appearances on the show until its cancellation.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Some Balthazar Getty images</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/15/balthazar-getty-0.jpg alt="Balthazar Getty" title="Balthazar Getty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/15/balthazar-getty-1.jpg alt="Balthazar Getty" title="Balthazar Getty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/15/balthazar-getty-2.jpg alt="Balthazar Getty" title="Balthazar Getty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/15/balthazar-getty-3.jpg alt="Balthazar Getty" title="Balthazar Getty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/15/balthazar-getty-4.jpg alt="Balthazar Getty" title="Balthazar Getty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/15/balthazar-getty-5.jpg alt="Balthazar Getty" title="Balthazar Getty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/15/balthazar-getty-6.jpg alt="Balthazar Getty" title="Balthazar Getty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/15/balthazar-getty-7.jpg alt="Balthazar Getty" title="Balthazar Getty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/15/balthazar-getty-8.jpg alt="Balthazar Getty" title="Balthazar Getty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1975 births</a> <a href=#>20th-century American male actors</a> <a href=#>21st-century American male actors</a> <a href=#>American film producers</a> <a href=#>American indie rock musicians</a> <a href=#>American male child actors</a> <a href=#>American male film actors</a> <a href=#>American male television actors</a> <a href=#>American people of English descent</a> <a href=#>American people of German descent</a> <a href=#>American people of Scotch-Irish descent</a> <a href=#>Getty family</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>Male actors from California</a> <a href=#>Male actors from San Francisco</a> <a href=#>People educated at Gordonstoun</a> <a href=#>People from Tarzana, Los Angeles</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeSlrm1tMCzmKtll5rBtcWMp5ytZaekv7W0jHFramll</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
