It will help if you are familiar with the interesting careers of Depardieu and Polanski, since then you can think about them while watching the screen.</p><p>Anything to pass the time.</p><p>Most of the film takes place within the same leaky room.</p><p>Water drips from the ceiling into buckets on the floor. Younger officers come and go, and an old man mops up and shakes his head sadly. We learn that Onoff, the Depardieu character, is a famous writer, and that the Inspector knows most of his work, great swaths of it by heart. We also learn that Onoff has led a complicated life, not always to the highest standard, and that the Inspector may be judging him for more than the events of a single evening.</p><p>Now about that name. Onoff. On. Off. Is it symbolic? It could be. Yet the film is in French, by an Italian director, and the wordplay is in English. That is permitted, I suppose, since French words sometimes make puns in English movies. If it is symbolic, it symbolizes something terrifically obvious, and the same can be said for the movie.</p><p>The performances are fine. They are not at the service of interesting material. Polanski himself, at about the same time, made "Death and the Maiden," a similar film about a long night's conversation and interrogation. It is much better.</p><p>By the end of the film, amid reminders of Kafka and Beckett, we learn the answer to the strange night's interrogation. Some members of the audience will have guessed it. Others will have feared it. Few will find it worth the wait.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46aZKmtopp6p7vRppiloaSuenKFmG4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
