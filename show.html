While the business applications that are being tested tend to be more CPU bound at times, the performance of the hard drive can and will make a difference in the more disk intensive video and graphics applications where large media files are typically being edited.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/hitachi1tb_03180730334/14246.png border=0 width=500 height=500 alt="IPEAK - Pure Hard Disk Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/hitachi1tb_03180730334/14247.png border=0 width=500 height=500 alt="IPEAK - Pure Hard Disk Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>AAs expected the WD Raptor drives finish at the top in our business application tests as their 10k rpm spindle speed and optimized cache play an important role in their ability to sustain high transfer rates, especially in the Content Creation benchmark where transfer block sizes are significantly larger and more random than in the Business application benchmark. We see our 7K1000 performing very well in these tests and finishing ahead of the other 7200rpm drives and even the older 8 MB cache equipped 74GB Raptor.<p>In fact, the 7K1000 is about 44% faster in the Business Winstone and 30% quicker in the Content Creation benchmarks than the Seagate 750GB drive. After reviewing the trace analysis files we determined that the 7K1000 handles small block sizes of data in non-sequential order significantly better than the Seagate drive. We did notice the drive slowed down slightly in the Business Winstone when it encountered large block sizes of data in non-sequential order. This surprised us slightly as we expected the increase in drive cache to 32 MB would have buffered this same issue we noticed on the Seagate 750GB drive. Overall, the drive offers a very balanced blend of performance across a wide variety of business and home applications.</p><p><b>iPeak General Task Tests</b></p><p>The iPeak based General Task benchmarks are designed to replicate utility based application tasks that typically are disk intensive and represent common programs utilized on the majority of personal computers. While the WinRAR program is very CPU intensive it will typically stress the storage system in short bursts. Our antivirus benchmark will stress the storage system with continual reads and sporadic write requests while the defragmentation process is split between continual read and write requests.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/hitachi1tb_03180730334/14226.png border=0 width=500 height=500 alt="IPEAK - Pure Hard Disk Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/hitachi1tb_03180730334/14229.png border=0 width=500 height=500 alt="IPEAK - Pure Hard Disk Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/hitachi1tb_03180730334/14230.png border=0 width=500 height=500 alt="IPEAK - Pure Hard Disk Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/hitachi1tb_03180730334/14231.png border=0 width=500 height=500 alt="IPEAK - Pure Hard Disk Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>The 7K1000 performs extremely well in the Anti-Virus and Defragmentation test where its 32 MB cache benefits read operations with results that mirror the PCMark 2005 tests. This is especially true in the WinRAR tests where large cache sizes are very advantageous for improved times and we expected better performance from this drive. It did finish ahead of the other 7200rpm drives but simply could not keep up with the rotational and access speeds of the 16 MB cache equipped Raptors.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH9yhZJobg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
