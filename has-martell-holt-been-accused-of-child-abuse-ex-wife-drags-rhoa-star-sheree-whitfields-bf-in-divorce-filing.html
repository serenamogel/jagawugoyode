After being presented to the 'RHOA' gang on a recent episode, the reality star's love interest was met with cold feet.</p><p>Martell filed for bankruptcy in 2020, admitting to owing creditors up to $1 million, according to prior reports. Martell stated in court filings that he owes less than 50 creditors between $1 million and $10 million. Martell made his 'RHOA' debut last month when Sheree introduced him to the cast. The actress told viewers that she met Martell through a mutual acquaintance and that she only sees him on weekends because he lives in Alabama.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>RHOA’s Kim Zolciak opts for new beginnings, snubs Kroy Biermann in her 2024 resolutions amid nasty divorce</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e29e0c61-da18-4db9-b28d-ff20c7e69a47.png><h2 class=split>Child abuse accusations</h2><p>Martell has also been accused of child abuse in court files by his ex-wife, Melody, according to The US Sun. Melody sought a protective order against Martell on January 11, 2022, according to Alabama court papers acquired.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the contents of the protection order are being kept private, the news outlet has discovered that the injunction was issued to safeguard their children. The former couple has four children. Martell is also the father of another child, a son, with Arionne Curry, who has been named as his alleged mistress. Melody filed for divorce after nearly 12 years of marriage in June 2020 owing to his long-term affair, which he acknowledged and labeled "foolish." In court documents, Melody claimed that her ex was 'excessive' and 'abusive' in his treatment of their minor children.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Internet backs Kim Zolciak’s estranged husband Kroy Biermann as he excludes her from Christmas post with kids</a></p><h2 class=split>Martell filed petition to modify custody arrangement</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>How many children does Sanya Richards-Ross have? ‘RHOA’ star and husband Aaron Ross welcome baby boy</a></p><p>According to a separate filing in Melody and Martell's divorce case, Martell submitted a petition on January 26, 2022, to amend the custody arrangement, asking for exclusive physical custody, and notifying the court that Melody had "violated" stipulations in the final order signed in March 2021.</p><p>He said Melody, with whom he co-starred on OWN's 'Love & Marriage: Huntsville', has denied him time with their four young children and has cut off the connection. According to the documents, he alleged that she went up to her residence one night in November 2021 after not being able to say good night to their children, and so she "served him with a trespass notice."</p><p>Martell then discussed Melody's protective order, in which he denied any abuse. "The plaintiff has falsely accused the defendant of child abuse in a separate protection from abuse action," he stated in the petition. "Plaintiff's accusation comes as she learned this modification action was coming through the reality show both parties are contracted with and sought to pre-empt this filing." On March 7, 2022, the protective order was terminated.</p><p>After both parties fought it out in court, an Alabama judge signed off on an order in March 2023. They were also instructed to alert each other if either parent plans to go out of town or out of state with the children. Melody was also required to submit her contact information "immediately."</p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>If you or someone you know may be the victim of child abuse, please contact the Child help National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child (1-800-422-4453) or contact their live chat services.</span><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>'RHOA' star Kim Zolciak called out over 'clickbait' statement as she denies cheating on Kroy Biermann</a></p><p><a href=#>Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann get into explosive fight as 'narcissistic' ex accuses 'RHOA' star of 'f******g other men'</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooJGoeq6t0a2cpaRdnbytwIybnJ6mXZawpMHSnptmp5ZisKm1y51kmpqlqLJusddmrqKelWKxs63GrGSroJ%2BWerTAwKtkrKCVp7KmedahoK2emZq5pb%2BMm51moZ5isarCzquanmWWnrmqusY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
