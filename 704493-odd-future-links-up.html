Tyler, the Creator poses alongside Syd, Taco, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Earl Sweatshirt</a>, Mike G, Jasper Dolphin, and more. They were also joined by <a href=# class=text-word rel>Vince Staples</a>, all appearing to be in good spirits. It's unclear why exactly the group linked up, but regardless, fans seem overjoyed to see them all together. With that being said, some users are disappointed that not all the members made it to the <a href=# rel>mini reunion</a>, missing the presence of <a href=# class=text-word rel>Frank Ocean</a>, Hodgy, Left Brain, and more. The <a href=# class=text-word rel>Odd Future</a> artists are off <a href=# rel>pursuing their own separate careers</a> at this point, so either way, it's interesting to see them revisit their roots.</p><p>"It’s giving 2010 and we love to see it," one Twitter users writes. "BROOOO THEYRE BACK," another excited fan says. The photo has left commenters taking a trip down memory lane, and pining for a formal Odd Future reunion. Unfortunately, Tyler has said in the past that <a href=# rel>the members are past that point</a> in their careers, making it unlikely that fans will get to see one, at least in the near future. He didn't completely write the idea off however, claiming that he'd be open to it.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Tyler, The Creator Unveils Full Camp Flog Gnaw Lineup: Kendrick Lamar, SZA & More</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-odd-future-members-get-together>Odd Future Members Get Together</h2></span><p>In a 2020 interview, the Odd Future founder spoke on whether or not the collective would ever get back together to put out another project. “<a href=# rel>Nine times out of seven, no,</a>” Tyler said. “I would be open to it, but I think everyone is kinda past that. I think some people base it on nostalgia rather than like, ‘Would it actually be good?’ Like, we don't always need a Bad Boys 5. Even though I like the last one. N***a, it's there, listen to it.”</p><p>He continued, adding that he doesn't feel like their styles would work together as well as they used to. “Honestly, the OF tapes weren't that good,” Tyler explained. “It was just a fun time, but musically, it's like, ‘Uh, coulda did better.’ <a href=# rel>But, for the time, it was tight.</a> I think now...and I could probably figure it out. I don't know if the styles will mesh much for a good cohesive thing. No niche like, ‘Oh, this is a good idea.’ Like an actually good thing. I don't know if the styles would mesh much with everyone. But, who knows, this could change in six weeks.”</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>ASAP Rocky’s “RIOT” Featuring Tyler, The Creator Seemingly Leaks Online</a></strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[Via]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZYF1hZJmpp2cXZvCtcHRnmSloZ6gwG7Bzw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
