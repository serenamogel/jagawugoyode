He also played the piano and, when he was 13, received a guitar as a gift from his father, Rodney, who had spent his holiday paycheck on the instrument.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In a March interview with the Federal Way Mirror, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.federalwaymirror.com/news/federal-way-student-goes-viral-on-american-idol/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tongi said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tongi said</a> his father had suffered a heart attack during his freshman year of high school and couldn’t work, forcing the family’s move to the continental U.S. because the cost of living in Hawaii was too high. Tongi enrolled at Federal Way High School for two years and is currently finishing his senior year at nearby Decatur High School.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When pressed further about his family at the audition, Tongi then explained how his father had died only a couple months prior and that Rodney was the primary inspiration for his music career. Tongi hasn’t explicitly said how his father died but <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CsZ33aqtD7_/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="revealed in an Instagram video" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">revealed in an Instagram video</a> last week Rodney experienced kidney failure.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Tongi said he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.federalwaymirror.com/news/federal-way-student-goes-viral-on-american-idol/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="didn’t plan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">didn’t plan</a> on mentioning his father at the audition because he didn’t want people to think of his Idol journey as a sob story, but he struggled to hold back tears as he discussed their connection anyway. After taking a moment to compose himself, Tongi began playing guitar as he performed “Monsters,” which he used to sing with his father. The judges gave him a standing ovation and a unanimous ticket to the next round.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“For all my life, my dad told me that singing is the only thing that was meant for me,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_MAesZsnMk" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tongi said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tongi said</a> on the show. “People thought I cry because I miss him, but it’s because I hear him singing, and I can hear his harmony. I can hear, like, how he would harmonize with me in that song.”</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Winning Fans on American Idol</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Tongi, who had auditioned for the show once prior to this season, quickly went viral and picked up 112,000 Instragram followers in the two days following his first performance.
