Her uptight nature not only affects her onstage performance but also alienates her from&nbsp;Jane&nbsp;as she refuses to treat her sister as an adult and allow her to make her own decisions. That their flighty mom (<a href=#>Polly Draper</a> of “thirtysomething” fame) thinks nothing of using the occasion of&nbsp;Jane’s 25th&nbsp;birthday to deliver the news that she and their father are moving to rural New Jersey, and that they expect Jane&nbsp;to move in with Bianca, only complicates matters.</p><p>Yes, Bianca was kind enough to get&nbsp;Jane&nbsp;an internship as a costuming assistant for the play, but she and Rob go a step too far when Jack (Gabriel Ebert), the somewhat emotionally stunted sous chef from her restaurant who is yearning for commitment himself, becomes attracted to&nbsp;Jane&nbsp;without suspecting she is autistic. He just knows that she is a refreshing upgrade from the hard-partying college girls he has been dating and thinks she is “pretty cool.” When Bianca realizes what is happening, she tells Jack to back off while Rob initially refuses to give him&nbsp;Jane’s number, with the decidedly non-PC warning that she’s “retarded.”</p><p>At this point, there is more to worry about Bianca and Rob’s wrongheaded attempts at protecting&nbsp;Jane&nbsp;than anything else. Besides, as her suitor, Ebert (a Tony-winner for his work in “Matilda the Musical”) does a fine job of evolving from potential jerk to perfect match in just a few scenes while believably bringing out the best in Krause’s&nbsp;Jane. As Shakespeare wrote, “The course of true love never did run true,” especially when the would-be top chef launches into an extended first-date metaphor involving recipes for “elusive soups.”</p><p>But soon enough, the course of true love runs very true. Predictably, yes, but pleasantly enough, as&nbsp;Jane&nbsp;gets what she wants—and deserves. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46jmKedXayur8DSZphmmp%2Bus7O1xKebZmpgZoM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
