Along the way, they will reveal personal stories from the show, specifically the bumps in the road that make or break a romance that aspires to be endgame material.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>Love is Blind centers around the blind date tradition, where prospective couples are set up by a third party, having no idea what the other person looks like. Done through a speed-dating format to find the perfect match, successful couples will continue to see one another, separated by a wall hiding their appearance from one another. The show takes its concept to the extreme, with proposals often taking place before their first official, visual meeting.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>Betrothed cast members will progress through to the next stage of the reality series, living together before ultimately deciding whether or not to make it down the aisle, all within a short period of time, in comparison to an average couple courting one another.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=true>In approximately four weeks, couples will meet one another’s friends and family, find out about their partner’s deepest secrets and romantic aspirations, and make all the major decisions about their future together – all while attempting to plan their nuptials. The reunion typically takes place after the wedding episode, where the hosts and fans ask questions about their married life, and whether or not it lasts to this day.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=135 data-injectable=false>Here’s all you need to know about the upcoming reunion episode, including when and where the episode will be available to watch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Which-Love-Is-Blind-Couples-Are-Still-Together-In-2021.jpg><h2 id=h-how-to-watch-the-love-is-blind-season-5-reunion-episode data-injectable=false>How to watch the Love is Blind season 5 reunion episode</h2><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>As always, Love is Blind, reunion episode included, will be available to stream on Netflix, free for all subscribers.
